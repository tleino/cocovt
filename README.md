# cocovt

*cocovt* is a virtual terminal (vt) for command composition (coco).

Use this with [cocowm](https://github.com/tleino/cocowm) for running Unix
commands like 'ls' in their own editable, scrollable, auto-growing
mini-windows.

At the moment this repository is a placeholder for cocovt to be
uploaded here later.

It is like the same author's [vtsh](https://github.com/tleino/vtsh)
but relies on the [cocowm](https://github.com/tleino/cocowm) window
manager for window management i.e. *cocovt* supports only one
session at a time but multiple instances of *cocovt* works great
with the [cocowm](https://github.com/tleino/cocowm).
