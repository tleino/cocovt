cocovt - Virtual Terminal for Command Composition
=================================================

Use this with https://github.com/tleino/cocowm for running Unix
commands like 'ls' in their own editable, scrollable,
auto-growing mini-windows.

At the moment this repository is a placeholder for cocovt to be
uploaded here later.
